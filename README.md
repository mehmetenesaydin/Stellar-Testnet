## Project Details
The Stellar Payment and Messaging System allows users to perform various actions such as checking balances, making XLM transfers, viewing transaction history, and performing multi-recipient transfers. The application is built using Rust and utilizes the Stellar Blockchain's testnet for transaction and balance inquiries.

## Vision
Our project aims to streamline digital payments and integrate a messaging feature within each transaction, making blockchain technology more accessible and user-friendly. We believe this project will enable seamless payments and open new possibilities for messaging in decentralized environments, creating a more connected and efficient ecosystem for users and businesses alike.
